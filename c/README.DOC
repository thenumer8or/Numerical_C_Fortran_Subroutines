Please read this document completely before attempting to use the NUMERICAL
RECIPES C DISKETTE.  Your use of any computer procedures on this diskette
constitutes acceptance of the terms of the DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, which is
given in full at the end of this document.

WHAT IS THIS DISKETTE?

     This diskette contains machine-readable source code for the C functions
in the book "Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing" published
by Cambridge University Press (1988).  If you do not have the book, this
diskette will not be very useful to you, since the code on this diskette does
not include the book's explanations or line-by-line program comments.  Details
on how to order the book are given at the end of this document.

WHAT PROGRAMS ARE ON THIS DISKETTE?

     All 205 functions listed in "Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific
Computing" are included as C source code on this diskette.  Also on this
diskette are the following supplementary files:

     -- NRUTIL.C  short utilities for error reporting, and vector
        and matrix memory allocation.  These are used by other programs
        on this diskette.

     -- NRUTIL.H  the header declarations file corresponding to NRUTIL.C

     -- COMPLEX.C  utilities for complex arithmetic that are used by a
        few programs on this diskette.

     -- COMPLEX.H  the header declarations file corresponding to COMPLEX.C

     -- MALLOC.H  a header file that declares malloc() and free(), included
        for compatibility with some C compilers.  You can probably delete
        this file, or replace it by one containing only a blank line.

     -- NR.H  a header declarations file for all the Numerical Recipes
        functions on this diskette.  Three formats are present: traditional,
        LINT arguments, and ANSI.

     -- README.DOC this file

HOW DO YOU ACCESS THE PROGRAMS?

     This diskette has one "hidden" subdirectory:  The subdirectory \RECIPES
contains the 205 Numerical Recipes functions, all with names of the format
*.C. For example, if this diskette is in drive A: and you are in some other
working directory, you can copy the function BCUCOF to your working directory
by the command COPY A:\RECIPES\BCUCOF.C <enter> where <enter> denotes the enter
or return key.  If you want to copy all the Recipe files, e.g. to a hard disk,
you can do this by the command COPY A:\RECIPES\*.* <enter> This will take some
time, since the number of files is large.  Also note that some hard disks have
a minimum file block size as large as 4096 bytes.  Since most of the files are
much shorter than that, the programs on this diskette may occupy substantially
more space on a hard disk.  We recommend that you create a backup copy of this
diskette using the DISKCOPY command, then copy individual programs to your
working directory only as you need them.

WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU NEED HELP?

     If you believe that this diskette is defective in manufacture, return it
to the place of purchase for replacement, or contact Cambridge University Press
at 32 East 57th Street, New York, NY 10022, USA.

     For technical questions or assistance, write to Numerical Recipes
Software, P.O. Box 243, Cambridge, MA  02238, USA.  Please note, however, that
the programs on this diskette are sold "as is" (see DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
below).  The authors of NUMERICAL RECIPES are interested in receiving reports
of bugs, but they cannot guarantee to correct them on any fixed schedule.  User
satisfaction is important to authors and publisher, however, so you should not
hesitate to make your comments or problems known.

HOW TO ORDER ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS:
